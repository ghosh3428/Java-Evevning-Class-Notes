Most important features Java 

Programming Language
We need to Compile a programming code
Compile -> convert the program code into a platform dependent code

Every Operating System has its different executable format
Window -> .exe
IOS -> .dmz
Linux -> .elf

1) Platform Independent

	Platform -> operating System

	java uses the concept of bytecode
	Bytecode -> neutral/platform independent code and we need a virtual machine to run this code

	this virtual machine is JVM(java virtual machine)
	JDK(Java Devloper's Kit)

	Javac -> convert .java to .class

2) Object Oriented language

3) Garbage Collection 

4) Robust

5) Secure ->java code is 80% compiled and 20% interpreted

6) distributed architecture devlopment

7) scallable


Java Execution Process

1) Editting Phase
	creating the .java file and writting the java code in that file
2) Compilation Phase 
	convert .java to .class(bytecode) using javac compiler
3)Execution Phase
	execute the .class file using java command

	a)Class Loader 
		it loads the required classes into the memory to execute the program
	b)ByteCode Verifier 
		check if the bytecode has been converted successfully follwing java specified rules and regulations
	c) JIT -> Just in Time
		interpret the bytecode line by line and converts into macine dependent code
	d) execute the machine code
	e) generate the result
